# AI/ML Math Foundations â€“ Resource Map & Cheat Sheet

This guide provides a structured path to learn all the foundational math required for Machine Learning and AI â€” 100% free, beginner-friendly, and organized for coders and builders.

## Prerequisites: What You Should Know First
You do not need to be a math whiz to start. But here's what you should understand before diving in:

## Basic Math Skills (Needed First)

Arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
Fractions, decimals, percentages
Solving for x (simple algebra)
Basic graph reading (x/y planes, slope)
Order of operations (PEMDAS)
Word problem reasoning
